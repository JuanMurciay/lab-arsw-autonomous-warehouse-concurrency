# ARSW — Laboratory 2
## Autonomous Warehouse: Race Conditions, Critical Sections and Thread Coordination

**Course:** Software Architectures — ARSW  
**Technology:** Java 21 · Maven · JUnit 5  
**Work mode:** teams of project 
**Development time:** one week  
**Suggested deadline:** Friday, August 14, 2026  

---

## 1. Purpose

In Laboratory 1 you explored **how concurrency can improve execution time** by comparing sequential execution, fixed thread pools and Java 21 virtual threads.

Laboratory 2 asks a different question:

> **What can go wrong when multiple threads modify shared mutable state, and how should we design a correct solution without synchronizing more than necessary?**

The laboratory connects implementation decisions with architectural reasoning. Your solution must preserve system invariants, eliminate race conditions, coordinate worker threads correctly, and explain the quality-attribute trade-offs created by your synchronization strategy.

---

## 2. Scenario

A distribution center uses autonomous robots to process parcels.

Each robot is modeled as an independent Java thread. Robots repeatedly:

1. request the next pending parcel;
2. process it;
3. register its delivery position;
4. update warehouse statistics;
5. continue until no parcels remain.

All robots share the following objects:

- `PackageQueue`
- `DeliveryRegistry`
- `WarehouseStatistics`
- `SimulationControl`

The starter project is **intentionally incorrect**. Several operations contain race conditions, inconsistent snapshots, and inefficient thread coordination.

Your task is not to remove concurrency. Your task is to make it **correct**.

---

## 3. Learning outcomes

By the end of the laboratory you should be able to:

- identify shared mutable state;
- explain a race condition using an interleaving;
- define invariants that must hold under concurrent execution;
- delimit the minimum critical region;
- use Java monitor primitives correctly;
- coordinate thread termination with `join()`;
- replace busy waiting with `wait()` / `notifyAll()`;
- distinguish thread safety from merely obtaining a correct result "most of the time";
- reason about correctness, performance and maintainability trade-offs.

---

## 4. Requirements

- JDK 21
- Maven 3.9+
- Git

Verify:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

---

## 5. Build and run

Compile and run the unit tests:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

Run the starter simulation:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.warehouse.app.WarehouseMain
```

You may change the number of robots and parcels:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.warehouse.app.WarehouseMain 24 250
```

Run the race-condition probe:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.warehouse.verification.RaceConditionProbe
```

A stronger probe:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.warehouse.verification.RaceConditionProbe 50 32 500
```

Run the pause/resume demonstration:

```bash
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.warehouse.app.PauseResumeDemo
```

> The starter is expected to produce anomalies. Do not treat a single successful execution as evidence of correctness.

---

# Part I — Diagnose before changing code

Do **not** modify the synchronization mechanisms yet.

Run the application and the probe several times.

## 1. Shared state inventory

Complete the following table in your report:

| Shared object | Mutable state | Readers | Writers | Possible invariant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `PackageQueue` |  |  |  |  |
| `DeliveryRegistry` |  |  |  |  |
| `WarehouseStatistics` |  |  |  |  |
| `SimulationControl` |  |  |  |  |

## 2. Evidence of incorrect behavior

Record at least **three different anomalies** observed during execution.

For each anomaly include:

- command used;
- execution number;
- relevant console output;
- class/method suspected;
- explanation.

### Evidence 1

```text
<your evidence>
```

### Evidence 2

```text
<your evidence>
```

### Evidence 3

```text
<your evidence>
```

## 3. Interleaving analysis

Choose one race condition and describe a possible interleaving.

Example format:

| Step | Thread A | Thread B | Shared state |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |

Answer:

**Why is the final result dependent on scheduling?**

# Part II — Define the invariants

Before implementing synchronization, define what must always remain true.

At minimum evaluate these candidate invariants:

1. Every parcel is processed at most once.
2. No parcel disappears from the system.
3. Arrival positions are unique.
4. Arrival positions form a valid sequence from `1..N`.
5. The processed counter matches the number of delivery records.
6. When the simulation is reported as complete, no parcels remain pending.

For each invariant state whether it is:

- required;
- derived;
- unnecessary;
- or incomplete.

Then write your final set of invariants.

```text
I1:
I2:
I3:
...
```

---

# Part III — Protect only the critical regions

Correct the concurrency defects in:

- `PackageQueue`
- `DeliveryRegistry`
- `WarehouseStatistics`

You may use Java's monitor primitives (`synchronized`) and other Java SE synchronization utilities **only when you can justify them**.

## Restriction

Do not solve the exercise by blindly declaring every public method `synchronized`.

For each change document:

| Class | Critical region | Protected invariant | Synchronization mechanism | Why this granularity? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |

Answer:

> What would happen to throughput if the protected region were unnecessarily large?

> _Write your answer here._

---

# Part IV — Correct thread completion

The starter prints a report before the worker threads have completed.

Modify the application so that:

1. all robots start concurrently;
2. the coordinating thread waits for all robot threads;
3. exactly one final report is printed;
4. the final report is consistent with the invariants.

Use Java's thread coordination mechanisms appropriately.

Document:

> Why is `Thread.sleep(...)` not a valid substitute for `join()` when waiting for a worker to finish?

> _Write your answer here._

---

# Part V — Implement PAUSE / RESUME correctly

The starter's `SimulationControl` uses active waiting:

```java
while (paused) {
    Thread.onSpinWait();
}
```

Replace this design with a **common monitor** using:

- `synchronized`
- `wait()`
- `notifyAll()`

Required behavior:

- `pause()` requests all robots to stop at a safe point;
- paused workers must not consume CPU in a busy loop;
- `resume()` wakes all waiting robots with a single coordination action;
- the simulation can continue and finish normally.

## Consistent paused snapshot

When the system is paused, report:

```text
Processed parcels
Pending parcels
Registry size
Current leader
```

Explain:

> How do you know the snapshot represents a consistent state rather than workers that are still changing shared data?

> _Write your answer here._

---

# Part VI — Verification

After your changes run:

```bash
mvn clean test
java -cp target/classes edu.eci.arsw.warehouse.verification.RaceConditionProbe 100 32 500
```

Expected target:

```text
Anomalous runs: 0/100
```

A correct result once is not sufficient.

Run at least three configurations:

| Robots | Parcels | Runs | Anomalies before | Anomalies after |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 8 | 100 |  |  |  |
| 16 | 250 |  |  |  |
| 32 | 500 |  |  |  |

---

# Part VII — Architectural analysis

This laboratory is about more than Java syntax.

## 1. Decision analysis

For your main synchronization decision answer:

- What problem were you solving?
- What invariant had to be preserved?
- What alternatives did you consider?
- Why did you choose the final mechanism?
- What are its consequences?

## 2. Quality attributes

Discuss the impact of your solution on at least:

- **Correctness / reliability**
- **Performance / throughput**
- **Maintainability**

## 3. Architectural boundary question

Assume tomorrow the warehouse is deployed as **three independent JVM instances** behind a load balancer.

Answer:

> Would your `synchronized` blocks still protect the business invariant across all three instances? Why or why not?

> What type of architectural mechanism would then be required?

Do not implement a distributed solution. Analyze it.

# Part VIII — Mini ADR

Create:

```text
docs/ADR-001-concurrency-control.md
```

Use this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-001: Concurrency control for warehouse shared state

## Context

## Decision

## Alternatives considered

## Quality attributes affected

## Evidence

## Consequences

## Risks
```

---

# Deliverables

Submit the repository containing:

```text
README.md
pom.xml
src/
docs/ADR-001-concurrency-control.md
docs/REPORT.md
```

`docs/REPORT.md` must include:

1. shared-state inventory;
2. observed anomalies;
3. one complete interleaving;
4. invariants;
5. critical-region justification;
6. pause/resume explanation;
7. verification results;
8. quality-attribute analysis.

## Implemented solution

This repository version includes the completed Laboratory 2 solution:

- atomic parcel extraction, delivery-position assignment and statistics updates;
- explicit worker completion with `join()` and one final report;
- monitor-based pause/resume with `wait()` and `notifyAll()`;
- a pause barrier that produces a stable snapshot at a safe point;
- repeated concurrency and pause/resume tests;
- a completed report and ADR under `docs/`.

The work is divided among three team roles in `docs/REPORT.md`. Replace the
`[Name]` placeholders there with the actual team members before submission.

# Constraints

- Java 21 only.
- Keep the worker model based on platform threads (`Thread`); **do not use thread pools or virtual threads in this laboratory**. Those were already studied in Laboratory 1.
- Do not remove concurrency.
- Do not replace the entire exercise with sequential execution.
- Do not solve every problem with one global lock.
- Avoid active waiting.
- Preserve the public behavior of the simulation.
- All code must compile with `mvn clean test`.
- The final race probe must demonstrate repeatable correctness.

---

# Evaluation criteria

| Criterion | Weight |
|---|---:|
| Identification and explanation of race conditions | 20% |
| Correct protection of critical regions | 25% |
| Thread completion + pause/resume coordination | 20% |
| Verification and reproducible evidence | 15% |
| Architectural reasoning and quality attributes | 15% |
| Code quality, Git history and documentation | 5% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

## Important

A solution that only "seems to work" but cannot explain its invariants and critical regions is incomplete.

A solution that uses excessive synchronization may be functionally correct but will lose points in **design** and **architectural reasoning**.

---

# Optional challenge

After completing the required solution, propose an alternative design using one of the following:

- `BlockingQueue`
- explicit `Lock` / `Condition`
- immutable messages / ownership transfer

Do not replace the required monitor exercise with the optional challenge.

Compare both designs in terms of:

- correctness;
- contention;
- readability;
- extensibility.
